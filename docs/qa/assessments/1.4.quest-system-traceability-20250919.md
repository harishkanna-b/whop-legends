## Conclusion

The quest system implementation shows good progress on backend functionality but has critical gaps in frontend implementation, security testing, and comprehensive test coverage. The current 45% requirements traceability is insufficient for production deployment.

**Recommendation:** Prioritize frontend implementation and comprehensive testing before considering production release. Focus on closing the critical gaps identified in this analysis to achieve production readiness.
