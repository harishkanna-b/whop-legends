## Test Scenarios by Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Quest Generation System

#### Unit Tests

**Quest Generation Algorithms**
```gherkin
Scenario: Generate daily quests with appropriate difficulty scaling
  Given a user at level 5 with scout character class
  When daily quests are generated
  Then 3-5 quests should be created
  And quest difficulty should scale with user level
  And scout XP multiplier should be applied to rewards

Scenario: Generate weekly quests with higher complexity
  Given a user at level 10 with sage character class
  When weekly quests are generated
  Then 1-2 quests should be created
  And quests should have medium/hard difficulty
  And sage commission multiplier should be applied

Scenario: Generate monthly quests with prestige rewards
  Given a user at level 15 with champion character class
  When monthly quests are generated
  Then 1 special quest should be created
  And quest should have hard/legendary difficulty
  And champion XP multiplier should be applied
```

**Quest Balancing Logic**
```gherkin
Scenario: Balance quest rewards based on difficulty
  Given a quest with easy difficulty
  When rewards are calculated
  Then base XP should be 50
  And base commission should be 5.00

Scenario: Apply character class multipliers
  Given a sage user with commission multiplier of 1.2
  When quest rewards are calculated
  Then commission reward should be multiplied by 1.2
```

**Quest Template System**
```gherkin
Scenario: Generate quests from templates
  Given a quest template for daily referrals
  When quest is generated from template
  Then quest should inherit template properties
  And target values should scale with user level
```

#### Integration Tests

**Database Integration**
```gherkin
Scenario: Persist generated quests to database
  Given valid quest generation configuration
  When quests are generated
  Then quests should be saved to database
  And database constraints should be enforced
  And RLS policies should be applied

Scenario: Quest generation with existing quests
  Given user has existing active quests
  When new quests are generated
  Then duplicate quests should not be created
  And quest limits should be enforced
```

**API Integration**
```gherkin
Scenario: Quest generation via API endpoint
  Given valid quest generation request
  When POST /api/quests/generate/daily is called
  Then response should have 200 status
  And generated quests should be returned
  And user_quests entries should be created
```

#### End-to-End Tests

**Complete Quest Lifecycle**
```gherkin
Scenario: User receives and completes daily quests
  Given a user with no active quests
  When daily quests are generated
  And user views quest dashboard
  And user completes quest objectives
  And user claims rewards
  Then user should receive appropriate rewards
  And quest should be marked as completed
```

### AC2: Real-time Quest Progress Tracking

#### Unit Tests

**Progress Calculation Logic**
```gherkin
Scenario: Calculate progress percentage
  Given a quest with target value of 10
  And current progress of 3
  When progress percentage is calculated
  Then result should be 30%

Scenario: Determine quest completion status
  Given progress percentage of 100
  When completion status is checked
  Then quest should be marked as completed
```

**Progress Validation**
```gherkin
Scenario: Validate progress updates
  Given a quest with maximum allowed progress of 100
  When progress update of 150 is attempted
  Then update should be rejected
  And error should be returned
```

#### Integration Tests

**Real-time Subscriptions**
```gherkin
Scenario: Real-time progress updates
  Given a user has active quest
  When user progress is updated via webhook
  Then real-time subscription should trigger
  And UI should update with new progress
```

**Webhook Integration**
```gherkin
Scenario: Progress update via referral webhook
  Given a referral-based quest
  When referral webhook is received
  Then quest progress should be updated
  And progress should be validated server-side
```

#### End-to-End Tests

**Live Progress Tracking**
```gherkin
Scenario: User sees real-time progress updates
  Given user has active referral quest
  When user makes successful referral
  Then quest progress should update in real-time
  And user should see immediate feedback
```

### AC3: User Interface Components

#### Unit Tests

**Component Rendering**
```gherkin
Scenario: Render quest dashboard
  Given user has active quests
  When QuestDashboard component renders
  Then all active quests should be displayed
  And progress bars should show correct percentages
```

**Progress Display Logic**
```gherkin
Scenario: Calculate time remaining
  Given quest with expiration in 2 hours
  When time remaining is calculated
  Then display should show "2h remaining"
```

#### Integration Tests

**API Integration**
```gherkin
Scenario: Load quest data from API
  When QuestDashboard component mounts
  Then GET /api/quests/active should be called
  And quest data should be loaded successfully
```

**User Interaction**
```gherkin
Scenario: Claim quest rewards
  Given user completes quest
  When user clicks claim rewards button
  Then POST /api/quests/rewards should be called
  And rewards should be displayed to user
```

#### End-to-End Tests

**Complete User Journey**
```gherkin
Scenario: User completes quest through interface
  Given user logs into quest dashboard
  When user views active quests
  And user completes quest objectives
  And user claims rewards through UI
  Then user should see reward confirmation
  And quest should move to completed section
```

### AC4: Quest Reward System

#### Unit Tests

**Reward Calculation**
```gherkin
Scenario: Calculate XP rewards with multipliers
  Given base XP reward of 100
  And user with scout class (1.1x multiplier)
  When XP reward is calculated
  Then final reward should be 110

Scenario: Calculate commission rewards
  Given base commission of 10.00
  And user with sage class (1.2x multiplier)
  When commission reward is calculated
  Then final reward should be 12.00
```

**Reward Distribution**
```gherkin
Scenario: Distribute rewards to user
  Given completed quest with rewards
  When rewards are distributed
  Then user XP should be increased
  And user commission balance should be updated
  And reward claim should be recorded
```

#### Integration Tests

**Integration with XP System**
```gherkin
Scenario: Integrate quest rewards with existing XP system
  Given user completes XP-earning quest
  When rewards are distributed
  Then user level should be updated if threshold reached
  And achievements should be unlocked if applicable
```

**Database Transactions**
```gherkin
Scenario: Atomic reward distribution
  Given multiple rewards to distribute
  When distribution process starts
  Then all rewards should be distributed atomically
  Or none should be distributed on failure
```

#### End-to-End Tests

**Reward Claiming Flow**
```gherkin
Scenario: User claims quest rewards
  Given user completes quest
  When user claims rewards
  Then user should see reward breakdown
  And user XP/level should be updated
  And transaction should be recorded
```

### AC5: Analytics Dashboard

#### Unit Tests

**Analytics Calculation**
```gherkin
Scenario: Calculate completion rates
  Given 10 completed quests out of 20 total
  When completion rate is calculated
  Then result should be 50%

Scenario: Calculate engagement metrics
  Given user activity data
  When engagement metrics are calculated
  Then daily/weekly active users should be accurate
```

#### Integration Tests

**API Data Retrieval**
```gherkin
Scenario: Load analytics data
  When GET /api/quests/analytics is called
  Then analytics data should be returned
  And data should be properly formatted
```

#### End-to-End Tests

**Analytics Dashboard Usage**
```gherkin
Scenario: Admin views quest analytics
  Given admin accesses analytics dashboard
  When dashboard loads
  Then completion rates should be displayed
  And engagement metrics should be visible
  And data should be filterable by date range
```

## Security Test Scenarios

### Authentication & Authorization
```gherkin
Scenario: Unauthorized access to quest data
  Given unauthenticated user
  When quest API is accessed
  Then access should be denied
  And 401 status should be returned

Scenario: Access other users' quest data
  Given authenticated user A
  When user A tries to access user B's quest data
  Then access should be denied
  And 403 status should be returned
```

### Input Validation
```gherkin
Scenario: SQL injection attempt
  Given malicious quest description with SQL
  When quest creation is attempted
  Then request should be rejected
  And malicious code should be sanitized

Scenario: XSS attempt in quest content
  Given quest description with JavaScript
  When quest is displayed
  Then JavaScript should not be executed
  And content should be properly escaped
```

### Progress Manipulation
```gherkin
Scenario: Client-side progress manipulation
  Given user modifies client-side progress value
  When progress is submitted to server
  Then server should validate progress
  And invalid progress should be rejected
```

## Performance Test Scenarios

### Load Testing
```gherkin
Scenario: Quest generation under load
  Given 10,000 concurrent users
  When daily quests are generated
  Then generation should complete within 5 seconds
  And system should remain responsive

Scenario: Progress updates under load
  Given 1,000 simultaneous progress updates
  When updates are processed
  Then each update should complete within 200ms
```

### Stress Testing
```gherkin
Scenario: System overload
  Given excessive quest generation requests
  When system is overloaded
  Then system should gracefully degrade
  And should not crash completely
```

## Reliability Test Scenarios

### Error Handling
```gherkin
Scenario: Database connection failure
  Given database connection fails
  When quest operation is attempted
  Then appropriate error should be returned
  And system should recover gracefully

Scenario: Quest generation failure
  Given quest generation encounters error
  Then error should be logged
  And user should be notified
  And system should continue functioning
```

### Data Consistency
```gherkin
Scenario: Concurrent quest operations
  Given multiple simultaneous quest updates
  When operations complete
  Then data should remain consistent
  And no corruption should occur
