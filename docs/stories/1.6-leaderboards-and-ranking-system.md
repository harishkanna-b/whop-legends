2. Real-time ranking updates automatically reflect user progress changes with proper caching strategies to maintain performance under high traffic
3. Comprehensive ranking algorithms incorporate performance metrics, growth trends, and character class multipliers with proper tie-breaking mechanisms
4. User-friendly leaderboard interface shows user's current position with visual highlighting, pagination, and responsive design for mobile and desktop
5. Leaderboard analytics and insights provide performance trends, ranking history, and competitive benchmarking for users to track their progress over time
